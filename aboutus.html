                        The federal government plays a huge role in Canadians' lives — from the collection of taxes to the delivery of social services,
                        and from the supervision of international trade to the safeguarding of national security.

                                which are governed by the constitution and its conventions.

                            Canada's electoral system is referred to as a "first past the post" system. The candidate with the most votes in a riding wins a seat in the House of Commons and represents that riding as its Member of Parliament (MP). The Governor General asks the Members of Parliament to form a government, which is normally the party whose candidates have won the most seats; that party's leader generally becomes Prime Minister. An absolute majority of the electorate is not needed, and is rarely achieved. As a result, power has been held by either of two parties for most of Canada's history. The party whose candidates win the second largest number of seats becomes the Official Opposition.

                            Although the law has allowed for a five-year gap between elections,
                             there have in fact only been two five-year gaps in the last 50 years: between 1974 and 1979 and between 1988 and 1993, and there have in fact been five general elections since 2000.
